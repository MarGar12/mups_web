Um.. Happy 2026! I've made so many new friends, lost some friends, and got into many new communities! I'm grateful for whatever has happened to me personally this year, even with the hellhole 2025 is. This was the year I was able to get diagnosed for my mental ill stuff, gotten better on drawing, getting a great great friend in school... There's too many to list. Even if I have been more emotional lately, I at least have some to accompany me, even though my mind doesn't feel so... But yeah! If you're seeing this, congratulations on surviving 2025! Keep going, im sure we will eventually have a better future when we keep fighting the problems we have in society today ^w^
