Screw you procrastination! God, you really held me back for so long on making my website- ahem. Anyways! Yayyy I finally have my own website >w<!! Getting off [straw.page](https://straw.page) now as im able to get more customizations and stuff! Though this isn't the most for now, im tired lol. The straw.page may be taken down at some point but im lazy to update it right now. The stuff I host is also in here so yeye! Thanks to Linerly for motivating me enough to finally make my own website! This stuff is powered by Hugo btw, a static site generator.
