A week ago, I got a new drawing tablet! It's a ugee Q6, meant for mobile phones, but im using it for my laptop instead. For some reason the drawing area isn't working properly for my phone, but thats fine, because it works nicely on my laptop! I felt like being able to draw freely as soon as I got the drawing tablet... Also finally having the opportunity to escape ibisPaint and learn on using Krita!! Can't wait to start making new drawings with it... I did already doodle with it a lot!
