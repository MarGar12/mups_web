      <description>&lt;p&gt;A week ago, I got a new drawing tablet! It&amp;rsquo;s a ugee Q6, meant for mobile phones, but im using it for my laptop instead. For some reason the drawing area isn&amp;rsquo;t working properly for my phone, but thats fine, because it works nicely on my laptop! I felt like being able to draw freely as soon as I got the drawing tablet&amp;hellip; Also finally having the opportunity to escape ibisPaint and learn on using Krita!! Can&amp;rsquo;t wait to start making new drawings with it&amp;hellip; I did already doodle with it a lot!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Getting off &lt;a href=&#34;https://straw.page&#34;&gt;straw.page&lt;/a&gt; now as im able to get more customizations and stuff! Though this isn&amp;rsquo;t the most for now, im tired lol.
